The concept comes from the small signal model of a transistor.

In the small-signal model, the change in the transistor current due to very small changes in each of the terminal voltages, can be expressed as conductances (gate, source and drain).

**Referenced to the bulk voltage**

- Gate transconductance:

(how the current changes with a small change in the gate)

- Source conductance:

(how the current changes with a small change in the source)

- Drain conductance:

By differentiating the equations with respect to the terminal's voltage, we obtain the "real" equations.
