Metal oxide semi-conductors use insulated gates to controlo barrier energies at PN surface junctions at source and drain. 

## Electron transport

### Drift 
An electric field causes carriers to drift

$J_{drift} = qn\nu = qn\mu(\zeta)$

where:

- $J_{drift}$ is the current flux
- $qn$ is the charge density ($q$ is the elementary charge)
- $\nu$ is the velocity
- $\mu(\zeta)$ is the mobility function of the electric field

**Illustration of the concept:**

### Diffusion

A density gradient causes carriers to diffuse. (When to doped types are put in contact for example)

$J_{diff} = -Dq\nabla n$

where:

- $D$ is the diffusion constant
- $\nabla n$ is the spatial gradient of charge density


Drift and diffusion are related by the **Einstein Relation**:

$D=\frac{kT}{q}\mu$

It expresses the connection between the diffusion constant $D$ which determines the forward and reverse currents, the mobility constant $\mu$ which determines the conductance of the resistor  and the [[thermal voltage]] $\frac{kT}{q}$.
At $T=0$ , well... $D=0$ and there are no internal diffusion currents.

### Thermal equilibrium

In thermal equilibrium, diffusion and drift currents are balanced ($J_{n}=J_{p}=0$)($J_{n}=J_{n,drift}+J_{ndrift}$ and so on for hole doped).
