Metal oxide semi-conductors use insulated gates to controlo barrier energies at PN surface junctions at source and drain. 

## Electron transport

### Drift 
An electric field causes carriers to drift

$J_{drift} = qn\nu = qn\mu(\zeta)$

where:

- $J_{drift}$ is the current flux
- $qn$ is the charge density
- $\nu$ is the velocity
- $\mu(\zeta)$ is the mobility function of the electric field

**Illustration of the concept:**

### Diffusion

A density gradient causes carriers to diffuse. (When to doped types are put in contact for example)
