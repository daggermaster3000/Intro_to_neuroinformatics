**Input:** $I1$ and $I_{2}$
**Output:** Correlation between $I1$ and $I_{2}$
**Settings:** $V_{b}$ for $I_{b}$
**Notes:** For it to work $M_{b}$ must be in [[Regimes#Saturation]]

The current correlator measures the correlation between unidirectional input currents.

Mead recognized that in subthreshold operation, the current-correlator circuit in Fig. 6.12 computes a measure of the correlation between its two input currents
