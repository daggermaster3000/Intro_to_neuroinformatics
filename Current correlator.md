**Input:** $I1$ and $I_{2}$
**Output:** Correlation between $I1$ and $I_{2}$
**Settings:** 
**Notes:** For it to work all must be in [[Regimes#Subthreshold Regime]]. $M_{1}$
is in ohmic region, $M_{2}$ is in saturation

The current correlator measures the correlation between unidirectional input currents.

Mead recognized that in **subthreshold** operation, the current-correlator circuit in Fig. 6.12 computes a measure of the correlation between its two input currents.

**Strength ratio:**
