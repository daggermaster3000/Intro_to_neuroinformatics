When in A, cell A fires, when in B cell B etc. Then when the mouse sleeps you have very quick replays where the order is preserved. Ripples happen in milliseconds. The spikes are not coming at random, but at a certain point in the oscillation phase (phase precision). => We donâ€™t need to look at spike rates, we need to look at spikes with respect to the oscillation and we know where the mouse is. => It is both, frequency and temporal (never black & white)
