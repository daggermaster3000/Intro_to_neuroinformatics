The MOSFET is composed of a MOS structure and two **pn** junctions. The source and drain are heavily doped **n** type (electrons are the majority carriers) and therefore have low resistivity. The channel is isolated from the gate by a layer of $SiO_{2}$. The gate is made of heavily doped **polycrystalline silicon** (low resistivity).  

We can view the transistor as having four terminals; the gate (G), the source (S), the drain (D), and the bulk (B). Because the **n+** source and drain regions can supply a lot of electrons to the channel, the device is called an **n-fet**. The complementary type is the **p-fet** (charge carried by holes from source to drain).

Almost all modern MOS processes are CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) In a CMOS process, both nFETs and pFETs are fabricated on the same substrate. Usually, we will assume a single well CMOS process in which the nFET rests in the common **p-** substrate, and the pFET rests in an **n**-well within the substrate.
