The MOSFET is composed of a MOS structure and two **pn** junctions. The source and drain are heavily doped **n** type (electrons are the majority carriers) and therefore have low resistivity. The channel is isolated from the gate by a layer of $SiO_{2}$. The gate is made of heavily doped **polycrystalline silicon** (low resistivity).
