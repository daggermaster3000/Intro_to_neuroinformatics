## Overview
There are place cells in the HC (= encode Space/ where the mouse is). Place cells integrate a bunch of features like Smell, Background Noise, Visual image of a corner, Texture of the
Floor, Somato Sensory.

In an experiment with the Morris Water Maze (behavioral test, **milky** water (=> cannot see), goal is to find a platform so the mouse can rest) the control group can after some trials search for the platform and find it. Mice where the [[NMDA]] receptors in the [[HC]] are blocked however randomly search the water and do not learn.

## How can we measure neuronal plasticity in the HC ?
![[Pasted image 20230123165602.png|400]]
We can in vitro (post partem) stimulate well-known pathways with electrodes and record the potential of different stimuli. The most studied synapses are CA3->CA1.

## Paired pulse facilitation
If we stimulate twice shortly with a small delay, there will be an overlap and there will be higher depolarization. It is an example for **short-term Plasticity**.
