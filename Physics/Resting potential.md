The intracellular space is hyperpolarized, we have potential stored energy

# The three basic ingredients 
1. Cell membrane
2. Concentration gradients (thanks to ionic pumps)
3. Selective ionic channels

The most proeminent pump is the sodium-potasssium pump ($Na^+$/$K^+$) moving sodium from the inside to the outside,  and potassium from the outside to the inside. $\rightarrow$ This process requires energy and sets up the concentration gradients.

As $K^+$ is present at high concentrations on the inside it will diffuse to the outside. As a result the **outside** of the membrane accumulates a net **positive** charge (because of the slight excess of $K^+$) and the inside accumulates a net **negative** charge. Because opposite charges attract, the excess charges will align locally to each side of the membrane.

## The cell membrane

1. Separates in vs. out
2. Electrical insulator
3. Electrical capacitor (stores charge)

## Selective ionic channels
They have a large conductance $g_{channel}=10^4 g_{membrane}$ and are selective for one type of ion.
**Computations in neurons**
result from:
- Channel selectivity 
- Time dependance of $g_{ch}$ due to:
	- [[Neurotransmitters]]
	- Voltage
	- Secondary messengers ($Ca^{2+}$)

## [[The Nernst Equation]]

## Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation
More realistic but more complex.

# The reversal potential

(or also called the equilibrium potential for 1 ion)
It is the potential at which the flux is in equilibrium and will determine what will happen to the flux if we change the potential.

**Example with $K^+$:**

## I-V curves
We can next graph an I-V (using ohm's law) curve for more insight into the system.

### Two channel-types
With two ions and respective channels, we obtain a new equilibrium potential. But the respective currents are not 0 and they cancel out. Therefore, the respective concentrations of the ions are not fixed requiring pumps to be maintained.
