## Post tetanic potentiation and Long Term Potentiation
[[Tetanic stimulation]] leads to post tetanic potentiation ([[PTP]]) and later on to long term potentiation. Long term Potentiation is a long-lasting effect where the amplitude of SPSP and the rising slope has increased (> Baseline)

[[PTP]] is believed to be caused by a large accumulation of Ca2+ in the terminal caused by a high frequency tetanic stimulation.

## Recording of LTP/LTD in HC
**LTP**
![[Pasted image 20230124142717.png|400]]
- When stimulated with high frequencies from 500-200 Hz => LTP 
- When stimulated with low frequencies from 1- 10 Hz => LTD 
=> dependent on stimulation frequency!

## LTP
- LTP after tetanic stimulation depends on high frequencies
- LTP involves multiple mechanisms across time which all induce long term synaptic strengthening
- LTP mechanisms that last from 30 min to several hours but **do not involve protein synthesis**
- LTP mechanisms that last longer than a few hours **require protein synthesis**

## LTD
- [[NMDA]] receptors are required for LTD
- LTD after tetanic stimulation is dependant on low frequencies
- Involves sevral mechanisms leading to induction of synaptic depression
- LTD and LTP act in concert to change information coding and to implement new memories in the brain.
- [[STDP]] is thought to arise from the same mechanisms governing LTP and LTD.

## Role of caclium in LTP/LTD
1. Calcium flows through the activated receptor
2. It targets the calcium/calmodulin regulated protein kinase ([[CamKs]])
3. Level and timing of $Ca^{2+}$ determine LTD or LTP
4. Low frequency synaptic firing (~5 Hz) produces LTD;
	high frequency synaptic firing (~50 to 100 Hz) produces LTP.

## Molecular signalling in the PSD (post synaptic density)
CamKIII and calcineurin bind to to $Ca^{2+}$ at a certain (low) concentration, and down regulate the formation of [[AMPA]] receptors.

## Input synapse specificity of LTP and LTD
A synapse needs to be active so LTP can happen

1. Cooperativity (induction threshold)
2. Input/synapse specificity
3. Enables associative learning
