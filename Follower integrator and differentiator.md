**Integrators** are a class of low pass circuits that filter out the high frequency components of the signal (often noise). **Differentiators** filter out the low frequency components of the input signal and respond well to its changes. Both are used to implement adaptation in neuromorphic systems. Adaptation is ubiquitous in neural systems and allows a system to optimize its dynamic range against the characteristics of the prevailing input signal.
