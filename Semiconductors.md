Crystals and other solids are classified by their electrical conductivity into [[insulators]],[[semiconductors]],or [[metals]] (order of increasing conductivity). Electrical processing structures are fabricated from semiconductors because they operate at an intermediate conductivity level that can be modulated by [[impurity doping]]. 

The classification of these materials also relies in the arrangement and propreties of the atoms. 

Electrical currents in solids are carried by the motion of valence electrons, which are attracted from the fixed positive ion cores. An electron is either fixed to this core or mobile and contributes to the current flow (but only if it has enough energy to break free from the core (**ionization energy**)).

## Energy bands

The electrons that are in solids can have different energy levels (free ones can be in any energy state), that are separated by forbidden zones **band gaps** (due to interaction with ion core).  The allowed levels are called **energy bands**. 

Each state can support a limited number of states each of which can be occupied by an electron or not at a given time.
