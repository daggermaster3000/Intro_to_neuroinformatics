**On-going research: iterative refinement** 
- We study the principles of computation of cortical circuits and validate them on neuromorphic systems that interact intelligently with the environment. 
- We exploit progress in technology to develop mixed-signal neuromorphic electronic circuits for emulating neural dynamics and learning in real-time. 
- We build analog/digital neural processing systems interfaced to sensors and robotic platforms that can (learn to) produce intelligent behavior
