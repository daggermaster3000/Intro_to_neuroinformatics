# Network overview
A winner takes all circuit is a network of competing cells that reports only the response of the cell that has the strongest activation and supresses the response of all the other cells. It essentially implements a $max()$ function. Here we consider a cluster of excitatory neurons that innervate a global feedback inhibitory neuron (Fig.6.5). Implementations: selective attention, visual stereopsis, tracking and head direction detection.

The transfer function of the inhibitory neuron is:

Of course all units may have or not a linear threshold and this complicates things.
