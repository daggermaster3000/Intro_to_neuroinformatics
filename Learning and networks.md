When we look inside the brain, we see a bunch of neurons and a mess of connectivities. It’s really hard to identify the connections among neurons, and with this information to understand how the brain works. We don’t learn how the brain works by studying neurons, the same way that just by studying transistors we do not know how a computer works. We know the brain does processing but we don’t know how it works. The bottleneck to understand brain is probably that we do not have the right abstractions to understand it.  [[Substrates of neural plasticity#McCulloch & Pitts neuron (perceptron)]] developed a computational model of a biological neuron in 1943. The McCullochPitts neural model is also known as linear threshold unit/gate. It models a neuron with a set of inputs and one output.
