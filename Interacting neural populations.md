We understand more or less how individual neurons/units process information but not really how the whole information is processed.

## Neural encoding of information
Humans are capable to learn things that we were not evolved for, for instance, to fly a drone. This is an inspiration for us. It seems to exist a general solution for solving problems: the brain. 

Neurons respond to combinations of properties, features, aspects of the situation, etc. Neurons are tuned to a set of values for the parameters they care about. For example, a neuron can be “tuned” to a moving bar at a certain angle in its perceptive field. It also responds to a certain velocity, position $(x,y)$, bar width, etc. Neuronal response is called firing rate $r(t)$. Although neurons are tuned, they aren’t super picky about the exact values. And, experimentally, neurons do not code a single atribute but a combination of them.
