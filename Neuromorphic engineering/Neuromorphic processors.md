- Analog subthreshold circuits. 
- Slow temporal, non-linear dynamics. 
- Massively parallel operation. 
- Inhomogeneous, imprecise, and noisy. 
- Adaptation and learning at multiple time scales. 
- Fast asynchronous digital routing circuits. 
- Re-programmable network topology. 
- Fault tolerant and mismatch insensitive by design.
