Influence of the bulk on the transistor. Lowering the $V_{b}$ increases the depletion charge which increases the threshold voltage. ??

**Subthreshold**

For a constant current, a $\Delta V$ change in the source means $V_{gs}$ increases by $\kappa\Delta V$. 


**Superthreshold**

$V_{Th}$ increases with $V_{s}$.
