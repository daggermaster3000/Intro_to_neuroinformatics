The term neuromorphic was coined by Carver Mead in the late â€™80s to describe VLSI systems containing electronic analog/digital circuits that exploit the physics of silicon to reproduce the bio-physics of neural circuits present in the nervous system

## Main goals

- To understand the computational properties of biological neural systems using standard CMOS VLSI technology as a tool.
- To exploit the known properties of biological systems to design and implement efficient devices for engineering applications.


## Principles

1. Combine multiple disciplines (neuroscience physics, computer science, electrical engineering,. . . ) 
2. Exploit device physics to directly emulate the biophysics of neural systems. 
3. Let time represent itself. 
4. Implement robust computation in autonomous agents that produce cognitive behavior.
