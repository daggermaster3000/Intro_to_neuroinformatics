## Summary
![[Pasted image 20230125140110.png|200]]
**Input:** $\Delta V =V_{1}-V_{2}$
**Output:** $I_{out}=g_{m}(V_{1}-V_{2})$
**Settings:** $V_{b}$ for $I_{b}$
**Notes:** For it to work $M_{3}$ (and all transistors) must be in [[saturation]]. The diff pair must be in subthreshold.
Can be used as a differential voltage to current converter or a voltage amplifier.

For small differential voltages (e.g. $|V1 âˆ’ V2| < 200mV$), the tanh(Â·) relationship is approximately linear and can be reduced to a linear one:

$I_{\text {out }}=I_b \tanh \left(\frac{\kappa}{2 U_T}\left(V_1-V_2\right)\right)$
$I_{\text {out }} \approx g_m\left(V_1-V_2\right)$
$g_m=\frac{I_b K}{2 U_T}$

$g_{m}$ is the [[transconductance]] of the amplifier (it has the dimensions of a conductance), but the output conductance is:

$g_{d}=-\frac{\delta I_{out}}{\delta V_{out}}=\frac{I_{b}}{V_{E}}$

where $V_{E}$ is the [[early voltage]] of $M_{2}$ and $M_{5}$.



**Voltage amplifier**
- Open circuit voltage gain (increases with the early voltage):

$Vout$ increases with $V_{1}$ and decreases with $V_{2}$ the gate of $M_{1}$ is called **non-inverting** (+) input terminal and the gate of $M_{2}$ is called **inverting** input terminal (-).

Often the amp is used as a comparator: outputs a high voltage if $V_{1}>V_{2}$ and a low voltage if $V_{1}<V_{2}$.

**Output voltage limits**
Since in the open circuit is normally at one of its limits, we will now determine where those limits lie. If $V_{1}$ is larger than $V_{2}$ , $M_{4}$ goes out of saturation.
