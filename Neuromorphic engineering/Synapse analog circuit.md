The analog of a synapse in VLSI is that of a multiplier, the [[Gilbert multiplier]]

## Pulse based neural network synapses

In a pulse based network, the weighted contribution of a synapse can be implemented using a single transistor.
- Pfet for excitatory synapse
- Nfet for inhibitory synapse
- The weight can be set by changing $Wi$ the biais voltage.
