Most circuits use the [[Transconductance amplifier]] as part of a negative feedback loop. The feedback ensures that the amp stays within its operating range. 



## Transfer function

Due to the Ã©arge open loop voltage gain the transfer function is almost unity ($V_{out}\approx V_{in}$). That's why it is called unity gain follower.
