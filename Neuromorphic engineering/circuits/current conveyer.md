It is a crucial computational building block used to add, subtract, amplify, attenuate, and filter signals in the current-mode domain, analogous to the op-amp in voltage-mode (Smith and Sedra, 1968).
The current is conveyed from the input **y** to the output **z**. Forcing $Iy$ , it is copied into node $V_{x}$.
