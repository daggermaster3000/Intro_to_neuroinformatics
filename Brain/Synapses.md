## Discovery
**Cajal**’s golgi staining methods suggested the presence of contacts between cells that were used for communication ~1900’s. 
**Sherrington** proposed the term “synapse” meaning to clasp to describe the structure, 1890’s. He suggested that neurons are not continuous but individual cells that touch each other.

## Soup vs Spark
Is Synaptic transmission mediated **Chemically** (Kuffler, Katz) or by direct **Electrical transfer of charge** (Eccles)?

Evidence for chemical transmission at the NMJ (Neuromuscular Junction) was widely accepted by Neuropharmacologists. One argument for chemical transmission was, that different substances could influence the transmission of information at synapses. Some of the physiologists thought that certain aspects were too fast to be mediated chemically.

**Otto Loewi**
Shows that stimulating the vagus nerve liberates a diffusible transmitter. The perfusate from one stimulated frog heart could be transferred to another and have an effect on beat frequency.
-> supports the chemical hypothesis

Today no more controversy: synapses are mostly chemical, but in nervous system some are electrical (gap junctions, f.e. between photoreceptors in retina there are electrical synapses).
