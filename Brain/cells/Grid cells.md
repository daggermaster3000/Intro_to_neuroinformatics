1 Grid cells encode for repetitive locations on a hexagonal grid (It will fire when a mouse crosses thes locations). Using many of them we are able to encode location in space (by correlation (if close to two locations both neurons fire)).

**Modules**
Next the grid cell can work as modules to cover the whole plane

**Array of modules**
Combining multiple modules we are able to localize the whereabouts of an agent in the plane

Grid cells also interact with place cells
