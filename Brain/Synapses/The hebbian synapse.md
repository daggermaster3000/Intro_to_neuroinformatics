## Plasticity at the synapse
![[Pasted image 20230124145240.png|400]]
[[LTP]] : 
- More vesicles in pre synapse
- More [[AMPA]] receptors on post synapse
- Bigger synapse

### Time scales of synaptic plasticity
1. Synaptic density size changes (Long term).
2. AMPA/[[NMDA]] ratio changes (Long term).
3. Number of spines changes (very Long term).

## Hebb's Idea
Hebbâ€™s Idea: If pathways of two types of modularities (i.e. visual and motor) often active together => association between the senses => then you learn (case B)

In other words: When axon of cell A repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing cell B, then A's efficiency in firing B will increase.

If A,B simultaneously active, $w \uparrow$ 

Adding neuromodulators such as dopamine can switch the whole thing.
