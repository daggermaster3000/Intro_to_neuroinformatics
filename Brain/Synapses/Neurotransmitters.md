They may be small molecules or peptides (although their mechanisms and sites of synthesis are different):
## Molecules
>mall molecule transmitters are synthesized at terminals, packaged into **small clear-core vesicles** (often referred to as synaptic vesicles)

## Peptides
>Peptides, or neuropeptides are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the synapse, sometimes they are processed along the way. Neuropeptides are packaged in large **dense-core vesicles**

## Release
$Ca^{2+}$ is necessary for release

Experiments show, that transmission does not work every time (stochiastic) and is therefore not completely reliable. The sizes of EPP is not always the same (some bigger/ smaller) and sometimes there are spontaneous EPP’s (without axon stimulation). ➔ **Quantum transmission**
