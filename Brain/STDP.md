Spike timing dependant plasticity is a biological process that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons in the brain. The process adjusts the connection strengths based on the relative timing of a particular neuron's output and input [action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential "Action potential") (or spikes). The STDP process partially explains the activity-dependent development of nervous systems, especially with regard to [long-term potentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation "Long-term potentiation") and [long-term depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_depression "Long-term depression").


Here we can see that postsynaptinc firing after the presynaptic increases the synaptic weight.
