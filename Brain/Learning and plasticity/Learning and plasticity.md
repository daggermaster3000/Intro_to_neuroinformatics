## C.Elegans
The simple worm C. Elegans, for example, has 302 neurons and about 7000 synapses and in each individual of an inbred strain, the wiring pattern is exactly the same -> **The genome stores all synaptic connections**. 
In the human brain, connections are mostly learned.

## Why do we need learning?
A species using the mixed strategy may thrive if that Sstrategy achieves a higher asymptotic level of performance.

A species using the mixed strategy may thrive if that strategy achieves a higher asymptotic level of performance. Intelligent behavior emerges with learning and is also what makes us human. For example toddlers learn to pick up objects much faster than robots that need thousands of trials before they can pick up anything.

## Definition

### Learning
The acquisition/storage of knowledge/information or the **formation** of a memory through **experience**.

### Memory
Stored information that can be recalled at a later stage in time.

#### Biological memory
Our memory stores:
• Our personal experiences
• Emo9ons
• Preferences/dislikes
• Motor skills
• World knowledge
• Language
• Cogni9ve Memories
• Spa9al Memories

Fundamentaly, we are derived from ‘learning’ experiences that have been stored in our nervous system.

#### Psychological categorization of memory

#### Priming
The Priming Effect, **occurs when an individual's exposure to a certain stimulus influences his or her response to a subsequent stimulus, without any awareness of the connection**.

> - Learning results in memory which will influence a future behaviour.
> - Learning is not always conscious, simple observation may suffice

### Plasticity
The biological implementation of learning. Plasticity allows us to form a memory.

### Learning in Neuroscience
• Pavlovian Conditioning
• Instrumental Conditioning
• Reward/Aversive Learning
• Social Learning
• Perceptual Learning
• Motor Learning

## Relevant temporal scales for learning

Memory in brain is not fixed, it moves across time (first in one area, then stored somewhere else etc.). In an experiment, a lesion in the hippocampus was induced at different points in the learning curve. When the lesion was induced during the first few days after learning the task => they do not know it/ cannot do it, but when induced much later => almost no effect on behavior.

**Conclusion:** Memory is **initially** stored in **hippocampus,** [[HC]] then after 30 days not anymore.


#pairedpulsefacilitation
Is a **short-term, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity common to most chemically transmitting synapses**, manifested as an enhancement in the amplitude of the second of two rapidly evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)

## Quiz

**A receptor critically involved in LTP is.....**
1. NMDA. ✔️
2. AMPA. 
3. GABA-B.
4. CaMKII.

**CaMKII (a calcium-dependent protein kinase) ....**
1. ...binds to calcium at a specific high concentration and triggers LTD.
2. ...binds to sodium at high calcium concentrations and triggers LTP. 
3. ...binds to calcium at high concentrations and leads to LTP. ✔️
4. ...binds to calcium at low calcium concentrations and leads to LTP.

**NMDA receptors work as a coincidence detector in LTP. The two signals that must be present are:**
1. A presynaptic signal followed by calcium influx. 
2. A presynaptic followed by a postsynaptic signal. ✔️
3. A postsynaptic signal followed by presynaptic inputs.
4. Activity signals in at least two or more synapses.

**The importance of NMDA receptors for LTP can be seen in a behavioral experiment with HC knockout-mice.**
1. Mutant mice learn significantly slower. 
2. Mutants don’t learn at all. ✔️
3. After a few hours mutants don’t remember.
4. After a few days mutants don’t remember

**During the late phase of LTP....**
1. ...the number of synapse increases ✔️
2. ....the number or synapses decreases
3. ....there are less transmission failures between synapse
4. ....the increases of synapses can be measured.
