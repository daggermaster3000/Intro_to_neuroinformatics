## Hebb's law
**Neurons that fire together wire together**

## Spike-time dependant plasticity

**LTP** long term potentiation:
![[Plasticity 2023-01-21 14.10.17.excalidraw.svg]]
If you repeatedly have Neuron A fire briefly before Neuron B the connection between A and B will become stronge
Why would postsynaptic fire before presynaptic ? Due to Network wiring /dynamics /activity.

**LTD** long term depression:

If Neuron B (postsynaptic) is often active before Neuron A (presynaptic), the connection from A to B will loose its strength/ go away
