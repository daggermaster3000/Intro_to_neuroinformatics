When deriving the Iâ€“V characteristics of the nFET we assumed that the current is constant in the saturation regime. This assumption is not sufficient, particularly for **short-length** MOSFETs. The drain voltage can modulate the channel current even in saturation. In the above-threshold saturation regime, the effective length of the transistor,$L_{eff}$ , decreases when increases because the pinchoff region extends further along the channel away from the drain. We describe as the difference between the drawn channel length,$L_{eff}$ , and the size of the pinchoff region. Hence, the transistor current increases with $V_{d}$.

The Early voltage is defined as the **absolute value of the voltage at which the slope intersects the voltage axis on this curve**.

**Formula:**

$V_{e}=-L_{eff} \frac{\delta V_{ds}}{\delta L_{eff}}$.

Ve is named after Jim Early who first analyzed this effect in BJTs.
