## Docked vesicles
Defines the number of readily releasable vesicles a synapse has available. A consequence of having a limited number is depletion at high stimulus frequency.
CNS synapses may have only a small number of docked vesicles on the order of 5-10 vesicles for a hippocampal CA1 synapse

## Cycle
![[Pasted image 20230121121630.png]]
1. Docking
Docked vesicles lie close to plasma membrane (within 30 nm)

2. Priming
Primed vesicles can be induced to fuse with the plasma membrane by sustained depolarization, high K+, elevated Ca++, hypertonic sucrose treatment

Vesicles in the reserve pool undergo priming to enter the readily-
releasable pool

At a molecular level, priming corresponds to the assembly of the [[SNARE]]
complex

3. Fusion
Vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release transmitter. Physiologically this occurs near calcium channels, but can be induced experimentally over a large area. The active zone is the site of physiological release, and can sometimes be recognized as an electron-dense structure.
