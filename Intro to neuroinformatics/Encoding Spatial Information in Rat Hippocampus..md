The hippocampus is a high level brain region (it has  no direct inputs (from the retina))
Oâ€™Keefe et al. 1971 found that how the cells in the hippocampus are active depends on where the rat is in space. Then the Rat's position can be decoded from population activity.

## Decoding the position from the population activity

=> Everything so far: rate coding (variable intensity is encoded in the firing frequency). 
=> You can encode information of the spikes also via their timing (temporal coding)
