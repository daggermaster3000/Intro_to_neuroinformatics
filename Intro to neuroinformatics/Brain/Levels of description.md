**Goal**: create an artificial intelligent agent
- What is the essence of neural computations?
- What details can we ignore?
- What can we abstract? 
$\rightarrow$ We don't know shite yet

We might chose to study single neurons, why? 
- They are the computational units of the brain amd constrain the network computations
- To emulate in neuromorphic hardware
- Basis of experimental method
