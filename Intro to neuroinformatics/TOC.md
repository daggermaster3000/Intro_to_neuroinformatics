## What is the course about ?
- [[Information processing in the brain]]
- Analytical descriptions of neural computations
- Learning and plasticity
- Encoding information in the brain
- Neural network models
- Neuromorphic engineering

We are now entering the era of “edge intelligence” in which dedicated cognitive “chiplets” will be used to provide intelligence to a multitude of [[edge-computing]] devices

• Today's largest computing systems exceed the capacity of brains, but need far more power

• Complexity of nervous systems is not matched in computer simulations
