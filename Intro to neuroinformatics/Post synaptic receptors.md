## Ionotropic
![[Pasted image 20230121135049.png]]
- Contains a ligand binding site
- Closed but opens when binding to the NT
- Contributes to fast changes in the membrane potential
**Example:**
NMDA receptor: excitatory for glutamate and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity

## Metabotropic

- G-protein coupled receptor
- Secondary messenger involved
- Slow postsynaptic processes (role in plasticity)
