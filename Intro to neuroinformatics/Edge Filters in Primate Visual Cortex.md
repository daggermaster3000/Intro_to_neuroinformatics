Some neurons encode the edges in images in order to represent the image in a lower dimension (compression)

V1 is the very first level of information processes, there are simple On/off cells that can be combined. In the V2, the filters are already more elongated. The higher you go in the hierarchy (V1, V2, â€¦), the more complex the processing becomes. The highest is the AIT cortex where neurons fire when objects or faces are presented.
