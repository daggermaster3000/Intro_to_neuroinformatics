The **_N_-methyl-D-aspartate** **receptor** (also known as the **NMDA receptor** or **NMDAR**), is a [glutamate receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_receptor "Glutamate receptor") and [ion channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel "Ion channel") found in [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron"). It is crucial for learning.

- Blocks calcium influx into post synapse
- NMDA receptors are not specific to Sodium, they also let through Calcium.
- Blocked by APV

## **Role in neural plasticity**
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) critically influence the induction of synaptic plasticity. NMDARs trigger both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) via fast synaptic transmission.

required for [[Potentiation#LTD]].

If you give APV (=NMDA receptor block), the plasticity effect is much less pronounced. This provides evidence that the [[NMDA]] receptor is crucial for learning and plasticity.
