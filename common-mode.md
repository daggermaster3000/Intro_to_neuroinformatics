Given a circuit that takes two inputs,
In most [electrical circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit "Electrical circuit") the signal is transferred by a differential voltage between two conductors. If the voltages on these conductors are U1 and U2, the common-mode signal is the half-sum of the voltages:

$U_{cm}=\frac{U_{1}+U_{2}}{2}$
