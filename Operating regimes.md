We first consider current as a function of gate to sourcwe voltage $V_{gs}$.


# Subthreshold Region
Small voltage are reduced so low power consumption. 

Increasing the gate voltage **increases the positive charge on the gate.** This charge **repels the holes in the substrate** and leaves behind negative ions that balance out the gate charge. The MOSFET operates in the **sub-threshold regime** when the **positive charge on the gate is almost balanced by the negatively-charged depletion region underneath the gate**. There is also a very thin layer of electrons beneath the gate (the inversion
layer) but it is negligible in this regime.

In these diagrams, the axis for the electron energy is directed upwards, while the positive voltage axis is downwards. That is, the quasi-Fermi level of the region that has a higher applied voltage (like the drain of the transistor) is lower than the quasi-Fermi level of the source region. Because the barrier at the drain is higher than that at the source, the electron concentration at the drain end of the channel is lower than at the source end. The **concentration gradient** leads to the diffusion of electrons from the **source** to the **drain**. The electrons that diffuse to the drain end of the channel are swept into the drain by the electric field in the depletion region around the drain. The electrons in the channel form an inversion layer.
