We first consider current as a function of gate to sourcwe voltage $V_{gs}$.


# Subthreshold Region
Small voltage are reduced so low power consumption. 

Increasing the gate voltage increases the positive charge on the gate. This charge repels the holes in the substrate and leaves behind negative ions that balance out the gate charge. The MOSFET operates in the sub-threshold regime when the positive charge on the gate is almost balanced by the negatively-charged depletion region underneath the gate. There is also a very thin layer of electrons beneath the gate (the inversion
layer).
