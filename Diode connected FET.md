A MOSFET operating in saturation in the subthreshold region, as describedby Eq. 5.1.1 for an nFET, has a drain current that is an exponential functionof $Vs$ and of $Vg$. In this configuration, the MOSFET acts as an exponentialvoltage-to-current converter if one of the two voltages is fixed and the othernode is the input. Above threshold, there is a quadratic voltage-to-current con-version as described by Eq. 3.2.39. The inverse function (a current-to-voltagconversion) is obtained by simply making the input signal and or the
output signal. The MOSFET acts as a logarithmic current-to-voltage converter

below threshold, and a square-root current-to-voltage converter above thresh-
old. The current-to-voltage conversion function in subthreshold can be derived

by solving for the output voltage in Eq. 5.1.1:
